    <h2><u>Queen Elizabeth's School</u></h2>
    <p>Queen Elizabeth's School is currently the No.1 school in the UK and has a total of 1,297 pupils attending the school. The school follows the <br> GL Assessment for developing the test materials and papers used in their admissions process as GL Assessment evaluates a diverse set of <br> skills, such as numerical ability, critical thinking, and problem-solving. In school however the test in GCSE alternate boards every one to <br> two years out of the AQA, EdExcel, OCR, and WJEC/CBAC. QE offers a wide variety of streams, such as Languages, Humanities, Design <br> and Technology, Literature, Mathematics, Arts, Religion and many more. However, if a student is not great in the subject he has chosen to <br> take for GCSE or A levels, the school may need to take action and overwrite his decision with a subject he is better in. </p>
